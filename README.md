# Stock Price Prediction Project

In this notebook, we will discover and explore data from the stock market, particularly some stocks (FPT, MSN, PNJ, VIC). We will learn how to visualize different aspects of it using Seaborn and Matplotlib. We will be predicting future stock prices through a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method.

This project that I based on a FARES SAYAH's notebook on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/faressayah/stock-market-analysis-prediction-using-lstm/notebook). Thanks to the author for contribution to the community.
